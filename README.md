<p><strong>Medieval Sorceress</strong> is my final project for MI 231: Game and Interactive Media Development at Michigan State University.
It’s a 2D platformer featuring the ability to teleport and trade places with the nearest enemy.</p>
<p>You can play the game in a desktop browser <a href="https://bobgwilson.itch.io/sorceress" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></p>
<p>I designed and developed the game in Unity, focusing on programming core gameplay systems in C#. 
It was featured at MSU's Fall 2025 Game Development Student Showcase.</p>
<p>You can watch the game trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGX7ZF_w1Z4" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></p>
