<p><strong>Medieval Sorceress</strong> is my final project for MI 231: Game and Interactive Media Development at Michigan State University. It’s a 2D platformer featuring the ability to teleport and trade places with the nearest enemy.</p>
<p>I designed and developed the game in Unity, focusing on programming core gameplay systems in C#. You can play the game on this page in a desktop browser (it doesn't work on mobile).</p>
